The project involves working with threads and processes. It is based on the problem of philosophers


This program is based on the following rules:

• One or more philosophers are sitting at a round table.
In the middle of the table is a large bowl of spaghetti.

* Philosophers take turns eating, thinking, or sleeping.
* 
While they are eating, they do not think and do not sleep;
thinking, they don't eat or sleep;
and, of course, they don't eat or think while sleeping.

* There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as there are philosophers.

* Since it is very inconvenient to serve and eat spaghetti with only one fork,
the philosopher takes their right and left forks to eat, one in each hand.

• When the philosopher finishes eating, he puts his forks back on the table and
begins to sleep. When they wake up, they start thinking again. The stimulation stops when
the philosopher starves to death.

* Every philosopher should eat and should never starve.
* Philosophers don't talk to each other.
* Philosophers don't know if another philosopher is going to die soon.
* Needless to say, philosophers should avoid death!
